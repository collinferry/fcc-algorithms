Free Code Camp is a San Francisco-based open sourced community for training full-stack developers. The front end development certification required completing a dozen projects and showing an understanding and use of the following:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- JSON APIs
- Object Oriented and Functional Programming
- Algorithms and Data Structures

I earned the front end dev certificate on 03/23/2016.

This repo contains all algorithm challenges completed. A full list of the challenges with links to intructions and live code can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.com/collinferry
